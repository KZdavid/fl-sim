"Federated optimization algorithms have been the central problem in the "
"field of federated learning since its inception. This chapter contains a "
"collection of algorithms that have been proposed in the literature, which"
" will be analyzed from the viewpoint of optimization theory, espcially "
"the theory of operator splitting."
